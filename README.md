Tools to help me track community stats
--------------------------------------


`build_swift_gerrit_history.sh` pulls down all the patches and comments

`new_authors.sh` helps track updates to AUTHORS and .mailmap

`parse_swift_patches.sh` shows stats on open and closed patches

`swift_contrib_stats.sh` makes some pretty graphs
